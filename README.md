# Implementing Typeclasses With Unification

Running this probably requires Scala 2.13.10 and SBT, but I've done all my runs on IntelliJ. 

##Quick Start
- Clone the project 
- Open with Intellij and build 
- Run the test file in src/test/scala/typeChecker/ConstraintsInferenceTest for examples
  - Running all the tests together creates a weird jumble of printing. I would recommend one at a time for clearer output.
  - You can also make your own test cases
- *OR* you can look at src/main/Main and typecheck from there.
